00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.680
the secret to any tasteful kitchen is of

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.320
course quality ingredients start by

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.240
measuring the space you want to fill

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.040
select a nice juicy rack of cabinets and

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.599
cut them into more manageable sizes

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.520
pre-cut white shelves are both

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.920
affordable and tasty

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.320
but a little marinade really brings out

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.119
the flavor if you like it hot like me

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.880
add some red doors for that extra spice

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.880
for warm lighting you'll want to

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.640
separate the white from the yellow

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.760
a bit of seasoning mmm holds all the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.559
flavors together

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.840
voila

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.760
garnish with tea towels and remember to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.399
